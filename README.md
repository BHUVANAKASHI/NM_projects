# NM_projects

**Numerical Methods Projects in Astrophysics and General Relativity**

This repository contains a set of mini-projects exploring core topics in **Numerical Methods (NM)** through applications in **Astrophysics**, particularly in **General Relativity (GR)** and **Gravitational Waves (GW)**.

Each project demonstrates the application of a specific numerical technique to solve or visualize a problem inspired by current research in gravitational physics, astrophysical modeling, or relativistic dynamics.

## ðŸ§ª Project Objective

To integrate the theory and practice of **Numerical Methods** with cutting-edge concepts from **Astrophysics and GR** by designing **individual short-duration projects (1â€“2 weeks)** for each major numerical method.

---

## ðŸ”­ Themes Covered

- Gravitational wave data analysis  
- Numerical relativity  
- Binary black hole physics  
- Time dilation and relativistic effects  
- Waveform modeling and visualization

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

- Each folder or file above corresponds to a project aligned with a specific numerical method.
- The code, data files, and results are self-contained within their respective subdirectories.
- Dependencies: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `h5py`, `scipy`, and optionally `waveformtools`, `lal` if you're using NR data.
